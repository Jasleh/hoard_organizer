Hoard Organizer

Hoard Organizer uses an Apache Derby 10.9 embedded database.
To compile, get the DB code from http://db.apache.org/derby/
only the lib distribution is needed. Make sure derby.jar is in the CLASSPATH.

To install, get the HoardOrgainzer.jar file and put it in a folder where you want the data to go (it will make a folder where it is).  Put a shortcut where you want to open the program from.
